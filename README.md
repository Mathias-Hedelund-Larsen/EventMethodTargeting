# EventMethodTargeting
Targeting the unityevents with an attribute to find private methods and limit values.

[Begin.UnityEventMethodTargeting]

In this asset you can add an attribute to UnityEvent fields (UnityEvent, UnityEvent<>, UnityEvent<,>, UnityEvent<,,>, UnityEvent<,,,>).
This will show a TargetMethods field in the inspector for the given UnityEvent and you can set up the search parameters for the event.
This enables you to target private methods, set limits to the values given, and lets you use the UnityEvent dynamic function by,
setting the listener mode to EventDefined. (The functionality is also added to ButtonClickEvent, and SliderEvent)

The attribute is called: EventMethodTargetAttribute
